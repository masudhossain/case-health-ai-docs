# 🔐 Authentication

Case Health AI (CHAI) uses **API keys** to authenticate requests. Once you have signed a BAA and agreement too partner with us, we will provide you with a workspace. Inside the workspace you will find your keys inside your Developer Settings > API Keys. 

We do not support public signups or self-service API key generation.

To access the API:

- Book a demo with our sales engineering team
- We'll provision your organization-specific credentials

👉 [Book a demo](https://calendly.com/fadi-casehealth)

After your demo, we’ll provide:
- Your **API key**
- A **sandbox base URL**
- Access to optional plugins like Compendiums and CMS policies

## 🧾 How to Authenticate

All requests must include your API key in the `X-API-KEY` header. All requests must be made in HTTPS. Using your X-API-KEY we will find your workspace and authenticate your request.
