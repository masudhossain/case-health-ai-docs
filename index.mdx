# üëã Welcome to the CHAI API

**Case Health AI (CHAI)** is a modern API platform built to automate prior authorization workflows using modular AI agents. We integrate directly into utilization management (UM) systems like MHK to streamline intake, eligibility validation, policy enforcement, and AI-powered decisions.

This documentation will guide you through authenticating, submitting prior auths, and leveraging AI agents and plugins such as Compendiums and CMS guidelines.
